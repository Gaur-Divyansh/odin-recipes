    <h1>Best Classic Potato Salad</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This classic potato salad is the best. Creamy, tangy, and crunchy, with a hint of spice and sweetness from
        pickles, it reminds me of my grandmother's potato salad served every Easter, or any time we had barbecue. She
        always dotted it with olives for a finishing touch, and a perfect briny addition. This is the best classic
        version of good old-fashioned, Southern-style potato salad. Not too much mayonnaise, with just the right amount
        of tang! Serve with grilled or smoked meats, it's the perfect side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Green onions and celery</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Wickles</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Yellow Mustard</li>
        <li>Green olives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Place in a large pot and cover with water by 2 inches. Add eggs and 3
            teaspoons salt; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 9 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove eggs with a slotted spoon and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the
            cooking. Continue cooking potatoes until fork-tender, about 1 minute more; drain. </li>
        <li> Peel and chop eggs; set aside. </li>
        <li>Add mayonnaise, onions, celery, pickles, sour cream, mustard, pickle juice, dill, and pepper to a large
            bowl; stir to combine. Stir in potatoes and eggs until well blended, mashing potatoes very slightly. Season
            with salt and pepper, adding up to 1 teaspoon more salt, if desired. </li>
        <li>ansfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with paprika, and garnish with olives. Cover and refrigerate at least 2
            hours or overnight</li>
